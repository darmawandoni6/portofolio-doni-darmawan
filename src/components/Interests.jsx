          Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time to playing
          games. I like playing games because it can help relieve fatigue from
          everyday life as a developer
        </p>
        <p className="mb-0">
          sometimes i watch anime, movie, or drama korea and anymore film genre
          sci-fi, action, or criminal
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
